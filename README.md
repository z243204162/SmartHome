This app is based on MVVM architecture. With the help of DataBinding framework, view and view modle can be binded together(2-way binding), ontop of that, Databinding can also bind methods (like: onItemSelected(), onCheckedChanged(), setVisbility()) with view model, which perfectly isolate views and models and makes development more efficient, makes maintenance & extension easier. 

In this app, I use Pubnub to build to real-time control and monitor system. 

To be honest, there are still lots of flaws need to be modified in this App.  I am trying to change his field from Environmental Eng. into IT industry, all my development skills are obtained from internet by myself. Hope this app will be helpful for my job hunting
